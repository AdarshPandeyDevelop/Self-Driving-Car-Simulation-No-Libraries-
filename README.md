# Self-Driving Car Simulation (No Libraries)

A browser-based self-driving car simulator built using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS — no external libraries.

## 🚗 Features
- Physics-based car movement and collision detection
- Ray-based sensors for environmental perception
- Feedforward Neural Network controlling AI cars
- Evolutionary training with mutation and best model saving
- Real-time Neural Network visualization

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS3

## 🏁 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. The AI learns automatically by simulating multiple cars
